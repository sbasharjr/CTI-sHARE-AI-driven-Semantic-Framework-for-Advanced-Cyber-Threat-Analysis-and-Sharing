## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### HTML Structure
```html
<!-- Security Operations Center Section -->
<div class="security-operations-center" style="margin-top: 30px;">
    <h2>üõ°Ô∏è Security Operations Center</h2>
    <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
        <!-- Active Incidents Panel -->
        <div id="activeIncidentsContainer">...</div>
        <!-- Blocked Attacks Panel -->
        <div id="blockedAttacksContainer">...</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### JavaScript Functions
1. **Data Generation**:
   - `generateSampleIncidents()` - Creates realistic incident data
   - `generateSampleBlockedAttacks()` - Creates realistic attack blocking data

2. **UI Management**:
   - `loadActiveIncidents()` - Populates incidents list
   - `loadBlockedAttacks()` - Populates blocked attacks list
   - `createIncidentElement()` - Creates animated incident cards
   - `createBlockedAttackElement()` - Creates animated attack cards

3. **Live Mode Controls**:
   - `toggleIncidentsLiveMode()` - Controls incidents auto-refresh
   - `toggleBlockedAttacksLiveMode()` - Controls attacks auto-refresh

### CSS Animations
```css
@keyframes slideInLeft {
    from { opacity: 0; transform: translateX(-30px); }
    to { opacity: 1; transform: translateX(0); }
}

@keyframes slideInRight {
    from { opacity: 0; transform: translateX(30px); }
    to { opacity: 1; transform: translateX(0); }
}
```

## üé® Visual Design Features
