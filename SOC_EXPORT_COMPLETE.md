## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Export Functions

#### `exportActiveIncidents()`
- Extracts data from `#activeIncidentsList` DOM elements
- Parses incident text content and structures data
- Generates formatted report with headers and metadata
- Calls `downloadTextFile()` to trigger download

#### `exportBlockedAttacks()`
- Extracts data from `#blockedAttacksList` DOM elements
- Parses attack information including source and timing
- Creates structured report with attack details
- Handles large datasets by showing most recent attacks

#### `exportSecurityOperationsCenter()`
- Combines both incidents and attacks data
- Performs security posture analysis based on data
- Generates executive summary and recommendations
- Creates comprehensive report with multiple sections
- Includes timestamp in filename for version control

#### `downloadTextFile(filename, content)`
- Creates blob object with text content
- Generates download link and triggers automatic download
- Provides visual feedback with success notification
- Cleans up temporary objects after download
- Shows temporary success message with auto-removal

### Security Posture Assessment Logic
The SOC report includes intelligent assessment based on current data:

**🟢 GOOD Status**:
- No active incidents (0) AND high blocked attacks (>10)
- Indicates effective defense systems

**🟡 MODERATE Status**:
- Few incidents (<3) AND some blocked attacks (>5)
- Normal operational state with manageable issues

**🔴 ELEVATED Status**:
- Multiple incidents (≥3)
- Requires immediate attention and response

**🟢 NORMAL Status**:
- Default state for typical operations
- Low incident count with normal attack patterns

### Recommendation Engine
Generates actionable recommendations based on data patterns:

**High Incident Count**:
- Review and prioritize incident response
- Ensure escalation procedures are followed

**High Attack Count**:
- Analyze attack patterns for threat intelligence
- Update security rules based on trends

**Low Activity**:
- Maintain current security posture
- Continue monitoring for emerging threats

## 📋 Error Handling

### Empty Data Scenarios
- **No Incidents**: Shows alert "📋 No active incidents to export"
- **No Attacks**: Shows alert "📋 No blocked attacks to export"
- **Empty SOC**: Generates report with "✅ No active incidents/attacks detected" messages

### Data Validation
- Checks for DOM element existence before processing
- Handles missing or malformed incident/attack data gracefully
- Provides fallback text for undefined data fields
